#TEST007#

#TEST008#

&Lost transparent story box. need to fix!

#TEST009#
*Fixed textbox transparency
*Added rounded textbox, but it's huge and ugly
*Found a slightly better audio track

#TEST010#
*Started moving things to config file (config.sec)
*Changed titles and stuff to something more general
*Added a delay in the main loop to help control cpu useage, but this is a bandaid at best.
 Uses about 30% of one of two cores on my Pentium D and 35-40mb of ram.
*Capped FPS at 20. It's a VN, it doesn't need any more at the moment. Can be changed in config.sec
*You can now use Japanese in stories if you have an apropriate font(s).

#TEST011#
*Added more config options
*Changed how intro screen runs
*Changed intro screen
*Rebranding from KNPB to more generic engine name.
*Reorganized main loop some. Should help CPU use a bit.
*Added VideoPlay and AudioStart function. Should be easy to figure out what they do.
*Removed some redundant strings.
*Changed main screen title font to something that renders better on Windows.
*Removed TextRenderMainScreen and merged it with just the regular TextRender
&Credits do not run at a stable FPS and I'm not sure why yet.
&The menu screen needs to be totaly redone in order to make buttons
 clickable. It was an afterthought at best and isen't funtional.
&Game still spikes CPU usage sometimes. I think it has to do with how
 images are being loaded. CPU spiking is worse on Linux.
 
#TEST012#
*Update readme
*Added license
*Intro can only ever be played once now, it can't be called again.
*Removed/Made comments in source more readible.
*Reorginized code so it's more readible.
*Added BGload/CharLoad funtion.
*Sound control setting added to config.sec
*After a ton of work CPU useage has been fully addressed! The game runs stable
 using under 10% of my CPU (2.13Ghz C2D P7450) 90% of the time under Windows.
 This is much better than the 30% average (with spikes to 60%) from before.
*Intro and credits run at a more stable speed now with fewer dropped frames.
*Removed time import as it's no longer needed

#TEST013#
*Added debug mode. Enable in dat/config.sec. Here is a list of debug info:
	CS = Current Scene
	CC = Current Character
	DN = Sees if the game has been told to go to credits. If you see True in game something is wrong.
	DM = Shows if Devmode is enabled or not
	AP = 0 if audio is not playing, 1 if it is.
	AM = Shows if audio is paused or not
	AL = Returns current volume
 Debug into does not show during the intro or credits. Only while playing and
 on the main menu.
 
#TEST014#
*Cleaned up variables so they all follow the same naming convention
*Cleaned up comments and fixed any spelling mistakes.
*Added option to run VN full screen or windowed. 

#TEST015#
*Handles errors when a module can't be properly imported
*Funtions/most variables split into seperate file (vnf.py). They are now
 imported into main.py where the main loop is.
